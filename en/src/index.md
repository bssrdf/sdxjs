The best way to learn design is to study examples [% b Schon1984 Petre2016 %],
and some of the best examples of software design come from
the tools programmers use in their own work.
In these lessons we build small versions of things like file backup systems,
testing frameworks,
regular expression matchers,
and browser layout engines
both to demystify them
and to give some insights into how experienced programmers think.
We draw inspiration from [% b Brown2011 Brown2012 Brown2016 %],
[Mary Rose Cook][cook_mary_rose]'s [Gitlet][gitlet],
and the books that introduced the Unix philosophy to an entire generation of programmers
[% b Kernighan1979 Kernighan1981 Kernighan1983 Kernighan1988 %].

_**Reviews**_

-   [Jessica Kerr][kerr_jessica]:
    "*Software Design by Example* is the book I'll recommend to every new dev…
    It is nice to you.
    It wants you to succeed…
    It's a bridge from 'learn to program' to working programmer."

-   [Jenn Schiffer][schiffer_jenn]:
    "I am v much enjoying gvwilson's book *Software Design by Example*.
    It makes me miss teaching, it would be such a fun text to use!"

-   [Emily Gorcenski][gorcenski_emily]:
    "There's a lot of books on programming
    but fewer books that couple software development with effective and practical use of tools,
    presenting a language not as a main course but as a part of an engineering ecosystem.
    Greg Wilson's book hits all the right notes in bringing together theory, pragmatism, and best practices."

-   [Danielle Navarro][navarro_danielle]:
    "The book is really bloody lovely."
